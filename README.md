  At first, we wanted to make a dog feed dispenser, but that plan went unsuccessful after a few days of trial and error. We decided that a security system would be something achievable. We started by wiring the hardware, and writing the code. After getting it to somewhat work, we started touching it up. It still has somethings we could work on, and this isn't the final prototype.
